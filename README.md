# Nighttime Driving Images Dataset
This dataset contains 400 high-quality photos captured during nighttime driving conditions. The images showcase various road scenarios, lighting conditions (streetlights, headlights, etc.), and potential challenges faced while driving at night. This collection can be useful for training computer vision models, enhancing object detection algorithms (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs), or studying low-light image processing techniques.
